- When create new components, make sure to use the translations hook and update the local files under mobile/locales and the type for the under mobile/types/i18n.ts
- When extending components, create common components instead of duplicate logic in 2+ files
- Never apply changes directly to the ios/android folders, we are using expo to build the native packages
- When a change is done to swift files in the plugins folder, the script sync-ios-extensions must be run afterwards from the frontend folder
